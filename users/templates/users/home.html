    <div class="content-text">
        <p>Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a class of deep learning algorithms that are particularly powerful for analyzing visual data. They have a wide range of applications, including image and video recognition, image classification, medical image analysis, and more.</p>
        <p>CNNs are designed to automatically and adaptively learn spatial hierarchies of features from input images. They consist of multiple layers, each serving a different purpose, such as convolutional layers for feature extraction, pooling layers for dimensionality reduction, and fully connected layers for classification.</p>
        <p>In the context of railway track detection, CNNs can be used to analyze images or video frames captured by cameras mounted on trains or along the tracks. By training a CNN on labeled data of tracks and non-tracks, the network can learn to distinguish between safe and hazardous track conditions, thereby enhancing the safety and efficiency of railway operations.</p>
        <p>This technology has the potential to revolutionize the way railway maintenance is performed, moving from manual inspections to automated, real-time monitoring systems.</p>
